    <string name="about_text">\
This game is played just like
regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
\n\
A tie happens when there are no further moves.
In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
both sides in the larger game.

    Select a letter from green box to create a word and click on done to get points.\n
        After 120 seconds you go to level two to score more points. Level two has no restriction for letters to be adjacent to each other to make a word. You can not repeat a word.\n
        For each 9 letter word you create you get a extra 20 points.
